            <h2>Introduction to VASL</h2>

            <p>VASL is a computerized interface for playing Avalon Hill's board game &quot;<a
            href="http://www.advancedsquadleader.com" >Advanced Squad Leader</a>&quot; (ASL) over the Internet. One of the most
            frustrating aspects of ASL (besides its complexity) is the occasional difficulty players encounter in finding
            opponents to play against. VASL aspires to be one simple thing: a way for ASL players worldwide to play more often
            and more easily. In short, VASL has everything you need to play ASL with anybody anywhere on the <i>planet</i>!
            Connect to the server and look around for a game, or drop in and watch others play. It's a club for those without a
            club, and it's free.</p>

            <p>To achieve this VASL combines two things: an onscreen playing area, and an on-line gaming club. VASL mimics as
            closely as possible the experience of moving counters on a board with another person across the table. Unlike games
            played over Internet chat sites (IRQ's), you are able to <b>see and manipulate</b> both the maps and counters on the
            VASL screen and transmit this information instantaneously to your opponent. VASL's chat and game room features allow
            you to view other games being played, share information, chat, compete in online tournaments, and even post items or
            game requests on the VASL Message Board. A VASL server is available free of charge, 24 hours a day, to anyone on the
            planet that has Internet access, and wishes to play a game.</p>

            <p>VASL is an amazing example of the cross platform power of the Java programming language. Because VASL is written
            in <a href="http://java.sun.com/" >Java</a>, any computer system that can handle the Java language (<a
            href="http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/java-ports.cgi" >Click here for a listing</a>) can run VASL and use it to play
            games with other players, regardless of the computer system they are using.</p>

            <p>Though there is no charge for personal use of VASL, you may not distribute VASL, in exchange for any sort of fee,
            without the expressed written consent of Rodney Kinney. If you become so enamored with the program (which you will)
            that you feel a donation of some sort is in order you may send it to:</p>

            <div><b class="parNonJust">Rodney Kinney<br>4053 149th Ave SE<br>Bellevue, WA &nbsp;98006</b><br><br></div>

            <p>Include your email address and you will receive instructions on how to disable the &quot;friendly reminder&quot;
            screen. You may also pay by credit card through <a href="http://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a> by making
            a payment to rodneykinney@comcast.net. PayPal is the easiest option for international donors as well.</p>

            <p>VASL is not a complete product by itself. You must own Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) in order to play. VASL does
            NOT incorporate the rules, scenarios, or components necessary for playing ASL. It is simply an interface, it is
            <i>not</i> the game.  For more information about ASL visit <a href="http://www.advancedsquadleader.com/"
            target="_blank">Multiman Publishing</a>. </p>
