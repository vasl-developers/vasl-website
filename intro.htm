      <h3>UPDATED: October, 2018. Originally posted by Andreas Ludwig on May 10, 2010 @ <a href="http://wargamecenter.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/vasl/">Homefront Wargame Center</a></h3>

      <p>For the newbie, playing ASL over the internet via the VASL program appears to be quite complex - on first sight - in spite of the geniality and clear arrangement of the program. The main problems encountered are the correct program setup and keeping track of a PbEM Game with its multiple log-files.</p>

      <p>Below we give a brief survey about the correct setup of the program and a short introduction to the international conventions in nomenclature of the single game files. If you are interested in background information on the VASL program please have a look at the official user's guide on the VASL website. In the following article, the focus lies on the practical application of the tool.</p>

      <h2>1. VASL Download</h2>

      <img class="img-rounded pull-right" src="./images/download.gif" alt="Download" height="300px" width="400px" />

      <p>The VASL program for a perfect ASL game by email or online - live via server - can be downloaded here at vasl.info.

      <p>A basic requirement for installation is a reasonably recent Java version. The platform is herewith of no importance -
      we play VASL both on Windows and Linux (SuSE 9.1). Also playing on Mac OsX is no problem.

      <p>To install the current version of VASL, you need to install the VASSAL Engine and then download the VASL module file.
      Unzip the VASLvXXX.zip file and place it in your VASSAL module folder. Open VASSAL and doubleclick the VASL module to load the game. Follow the <a
      href="./download.htm">Downloads</a> link above for the most recent VASL version and the link to the necessary VASSAL Engine
      version.

      <p>Important: For VASL versions 6.4.2 and earlier, the mapboards have to be downloaded as well, because without them playing is impossible. The <a
      href="./boards.htm">Boards</a> and <a href="./overlays.htm">Overlays</a> can be downloaded here as well. Create a board
      folder on your system and extract the boards into it. Inside that folder, create an overlays folder, and extract the
      overlays into that folder. For version 6.4.3, it is no longer necessary to manually download the boards: see Board Directory under General Preferences below. 

      <h2>2. Installing and Running</h2>

      <p>After downloading the VASSAL engine, open the exe file and the program will guide you through the installation process.
      After that you can put the downloaded VASL mod file into a directory where you want to have it, it doesn't matter where,
      just make sure you name it correctly so you can easily find it. Anytime you want to play VASL you have to start VASSAL and
      then open the VASL Mod (since VASSAL is an engine that allows for many games to be played it's a good idea to create a
      central VASSAL Mods folder where you put all mods (=games) that you want to use).

      <h3>Who am I?</h3>

      <p>Once everything is unpacked and installed, VASL starts automatically for the first time when you open the module in the
      main VASSAL window. First it asks for a user name. Under this name you will appear in the VASL world, either by logging-in
      on the online-server or when sending your moves to your opponent by email. At this point an explicit warning: Alias and
      fantasy names are not wanted or popular and actually frowned upon! It is possible to log in as "Terminator2000? or "Easy
      Company", but you will often get a rebuke or a discrete hint by other players that you will not find an opponent this way.

      <p>Especially the anglophone ASL-scene (American, British and Australian players) doesn't like anonymous or disguised
      people loitering on their servers watching their games (being a spectator is also possible with VASL, but more on this
      later). Because games with others are often Area rated, it makes no sense to play with a nameless player.

      <p>This is why we give you a well-meant advice: Enter your real name, at least your first name, when VASL prompts for a
      name (if you already are a registered AREA member, enter your name connected to your AREA ID, so other players can check
      out your rating and your gaming experience). Otherwise you will attract negative attention on your first visit in the VASL
      world or you will find fewer people helping you or playing an introductory game with you. The HFC also accepts and follows
      this international convention.

      <p>One final hint: This user name is not ultimate. If you recognize that it was not a very good idea to enter any nonsense
      here, you will be able to change your name later in your preferences any time.

      <p>Besides asking for your user name, VASL asks for a password. This is relevant for PbEM and live-game because it
      guarantees that only the authorized player is able to see/reveal his hidden units. The password will never be asked for
      later, it is only for assignment to one side in a game and for the protection of units.

      <h3>Preferences</h3>

      <img class="img-rounded pull-right" src="./images/preferences.gif" alt="Preferences" height="auto" width="200px" />

      <p>In your next step, you should adjust the preferences. You will find them under "File" - "Preferences". In the help file
      you will find explanations for all points listed here, but it's better to rely on what is common and what makes sense.

      <h4>General Tab</h4>

      <p>For the "General" preferences, they are recommended to be set as follows:

      <ul>

        <li>Let opponent unconceal my units: ON - For PBEM, it speeds up the PbEM game if you can unconceal your opponent's units
        when they lose their concealment by being shot upon. But in general it is not advisable to switch it on because the error
        ratio is very high or sometimes units are unconcealed by mistake. You should consider this particular case with your game
        partner. Recommended is to switch it ON for PBEM.

        <li>Center on Opponents Moves: ON - If you run your opponent's log file or if the opponent moves his units anywhere on the
        board in a live match, VASL automatically centers the view on this spot. Otherwise you run the risk of missing a movement
        if you have a small monitor or play a larger scenario.

        <li>Auto Report Moves: ON - This is of utmost importance for a PbEM game. This function guarantees that all actions
        (moving, concealing, placing of counters, LOS-checking, dice rolling) are recorded in the chat-window (and so in the log
        file). It is not always sufficient just to move the counters on the board, even though the opponent can see this, too.
        Often it is just helpful to read who moved where. VASL automatically records the Hex numbers the units moved to and writes
        down where which counters have been placed. Usually this function is switched on by all players, so you should follow
        their example.

        <li>Ask to ensure logging after a replay: ON - This is also important for a PbEM game. This function will ensure that you
        are prompted to start a new log to record your actions.

        <li>Used combined application window: ON - at least that's what we prefer. It's a matter of taste whether you want to have
        two windows hovering around on your monitor or simply have one combined window at the top of the screen where it doesn't
        get in the way.

        <li>Board Directory: This is the place to specify the path where the boards will be stored on your computer - it is recommended that you specify (and create if required) a
        directory in your User area ("c:\USERS\<your user name>\vasl\boards" on Windows). When you start VASL, all available boards will
	be listed in the board selection dropdown list. Clicking on a board will download the latest version to your directory. You must be 
	connected to the internet for this to work. You must specify a board directory or playing is impossible.

        <li>Use Arrow Keys to Scroll: ON or OFF. It's a matter of individual preference whether to scroll with the arrow keys or
        just with the mouse.

        <li>Disable automatic stack display: OFF - VASL has a comfortable feature: If you move your mouse cursor over a stack, this
        stack unfolds automatically (of course not the opponent's concealed stacks). If you switch this option on, this feature doesn't
        work and you have to press the CTRL-button each time if you want to see the contents of a stack. Maybe some people like it that
        way, but it is definitively smoother unfolding the stack by mouse hovering.

      </ul>

      <h4>Personal Tab</h4>

      <p>This is where you enter or update your VASL user name and password.</p>

      <p>In the Personal Info, you can enter some information about your person (preferably in English) e.g where you live,
      which Consims besides ASL you play, how old you are and other things, such as your hobbies or a link to your personal  or
      favorite homepage. HFC friends are cordially invited to set a link to our wargaming site ;-)

      <h4>LOS Tab</h4>

      <p>Here you can choose the colors of your preference for the LOS-check lines. We prefer traffic light colours - green for
      free LOS, yellow for hindrance LOS and red for blocked LOS, but this is your own choice. Whether you switch on "Retain LOS
      hindrance counters" is a matter of your individual preference (e.g. if a wreck hinders a LOS, you can fade it in or out).
      "Snap Thread to grid" orients the LOS-line automatically to the hex grid so that it is not placed anywhere in the free
      space. "Verbose LOS mode" should be ON, because then during the LOS check it is automatically explained why and where the
      LOS is blocked, how many hindrances there are or on which level a counter is positioned. Without this LOS mode you just
      have the pure line without any explanations. Keep in mind that "Verbose LOS mode" uses some of your PC resources, so if
      you are low on RAM on your computer, switching this feature Off can help to improve the performance.

      <h4>Chat Window Tab</h4>

      <p>In the "Chat Window" tab, you can adjust the color of the text being displayed. <u>Important:</u> The adjustments made
      here are relevant only for your own window (in which the log-files are displayed); if the opponent sets pink for his
      opponents' messages, you cannot prevent that your theatric battle announcements are displayed in pink. 'Game Messages'
      are, for example, the moving reports of the counters. 'System Messages' are dice roll results. These should be
      differentiated by flashy colours from other text messages so you don't miss them.

      <h4>Extensions Tab</h4>

      <p>In the "Extensions" tab, you can specify the folder to load VASL extensions from.

      <h4>Sounds Tab</h4>

      <p>A sound can be specified here to be played as a wake up signal. Just select a .wav file from your system.

      <h4>Server Tab</h4>

      <p>For the "Server" tab, the available servers are listed. The VASSAL Legacy server is automatically configured, but the
      Jabber Server and P2P Network require additional information to be used. Click on the server name, and then click the Edit
      button to specify your configuration.

      <p>With this the basic adjustments are done and you are ready for successful gaming!

      <h2>3. Play-by-Email with VASL (PBEM)</h2>

      <img class="img-rounded pull-right" src="./images/chat.gif" alt="Chat Window" height="auto" width="200px" />

      <p>The core of a VASL PbEM is the creation of a so-called "Log File". VASL has an outstanding function, enabling the
      player to "record" his moves, allowing his opponent to replay them step by step. These recordings are the so-called "Log
      Files". They journalize the moves (only of the counters, but if the "Auto Report Moves" option is switched to ON, also as
      text messages) as well as any other action. Furthermore, you can post any comments in the Chat window (recommended!). E.g.
      you count aloud the movement factors while moving with infantry, declare your shots exactly (who fires at whom with how
      many factors), who is CX and so on. Additionally you move your counters, roll with the system inherent dice (or use a
      web-based dice roller, which can be done right from the  VASL interface) and do everything you also do in a face-to-face
      game&#8230; including psychological warfare and propaganda ;)

      <h3>Game Start - Setup</h3>

      <img class="img-rounded pull-left" src="./images/counters.gif" alt="Counters" height="auto" width="200px" />

      <p>At game start the opponents agree on a scenario and on who is playing which side. The player setting up first creates
      his Setup File. You take the scenario you want to play and click on "File" - "New game". You then will be asked for the
      boards and you state which boards will be used in this scenario. In this window it is also possible to arrange several
      boards in any desired order, to flip them and to modify terrain according to SSR (e.g. turn wooden houses into stone
      houses, remove roads, modify terrain etc.). Also boards can be cut off when only certain hexrows are playable ("Crop
      Boards"). Also overlays can be chosen here.

      <p>Once all desired boards are loaded and arranged, click on "OK" and the regular game window opens. Clicking on the "467"
      Button in the control bar opens the counter-window. Now all counters appearing in the scenario can be chosen and placed on
      the board. Of course vehicles can be turned by using the context menu (right mouse button). It is also well-tried to mark
      victory hexes, e.g. with a nationality marker when the Germans have to occupy certain hexes or houses. This improves the
      overview.

      <p>When all units are placed on the board and you finished your setup, save this setup-file with "File" - "Save Game". Now
      the program asks for a name, recommended is the player's side, for example "German_Setup.scen" or "German_Setup.vsav".
      Using an ending such as .vsav or .scen is not really necessary, but it prevents compatibility problems occurring sometimes
      when opponents use different platforms. At least you cannot do anything wrong with using a ".vsav"-ending, it doesn't
      hurt. Eventually send this file to your opponent as an email attachment.

      <p>The opponent starts his VASL program and clicks on "File" - "Load Game", where he indicates the location of the
      received setup-file. The board opens with the already placed German units and you can place your own units onboard (or
      off-board, if indicated by SSR). If the setup is done, it is recommended to save it again e.g. as "US_Setup.vsav".

      <p>Hint: It is recommended to create a separate directory for each PbEM game, e.g. in a specific PbEM directory. You can
      call it something like "Denny vs. Andy" (of course, including your own names here ;), creating a sub-folder there called
      "Game 1: ASL Sc. 15? and in there a subdirectory for the matching side, where you store the log files immediately when
      received by email (more about the naming of game files later). Of course, the game file organization on your PC is up to
      you.

      <p>The player beginning with turn 1 clicks on "File" - "Begin  Logfile". The program now asks for a name for this file.
      The following naming system has proven useful since good old Squad-Leader-times (of course you can agree with your
      opponent on any other system, but it's a good idea to get used to this system because many players use it and it prevents
      errors and confusion):

      <h3>Naming the Logfiles</h3>

      <p>The name of a PbEM log file consists of the following components:
      <ul>
        <li>Scenario-Number
        <li>Phasing Side
        <li>Turn-Number
        <li>letter
      </ul>

      <p>Example: TAC51-GT1b.log

      <p>Explanation: TAC51 is the name of the (ASL) scenario. Alternatives would be: ASL12, T01 etc.

      <p>The name of the scenario is separated with a dash from the rest of the name.

      <p>GT means "German Turn". Alternatives are AT (American Turn), ST (Soviet Turn), BT (British Turn), JT (Japanese Turn),
      FT (French Turn).

      <p>Minor Country opponents are abbreviated with two letters (BeT = Belgian Turn, FiT = Finnish Turn, NoT = Norwegian Turn
      etc.).

      <p>The number behind GT means 1st turn.

      <p>The letter behind GT1 indicates the current file of the turn. The numbering is consecutive and done by both Players.

      <p>In Detail:

      <p>The German player begins with his first turn (e.g. Rally Phase to Movement Phase). His file is called: TAC51-GT1a.log
      ("1st file of the 1st German turn"). He sends it to his opponent. The opponent opens it and makes his moves (e.g.
      Defensive fire) in a new log-file called TAC51-GT1b.log. He sends it back. Each file of the 1st German turn receives the
      next letter in the alphabet. If it happens that a file is send often to and fro because of large amount of movement and
      defensive fire, the German player answers with GT1c, the opponent with GT1d and so on until the German turn is over.

      <p>When the opponent (for example the Belgians in TAC51) begins with his own turn, his file is called BeT1a. He sends it
      to the German player who makes his defensive fire in BeT1b, sends it back and so on. If the Belgian turn is over, the
      German player starts with GT2a (b, c, d,&#8230;), then the Belgians with BeT2a (b, c, d&#8230;.).

      <p>By using this method it is easy always to recognize the most current file: the highest turn number with the highest
      letter. Furthermore there will be no chaos and no wrong naming - a common problem when using a system where the phases are
      used in the filename (e.g. German_RPh-MPh). It often happens that these phases are not actually made in the respective
      files, because something unexpected happens.

      <p>The log file - the unknown creature

      <p>After naming the first log file accordingly (e.g. ASL17-GT1a.log), the player starts with his moves. VASL is recording
      everything that's going on. Usually the game begins with the Rally Phase or, more exactly, with Wind Change. You write in
      the chat window: "RPh". The common ASL-Shortcuts are used in a PbEM game, as all ASL players are familiar with them. Then
      announce "WC" (Wind change) and roll two dice by pushing the button with the two dice in the control bar (of course the
      button right to this button with only one die symbol rolls only one die). The first number always represents the Colored
      Die, the second is the white one. This is important for ROF and all other aspects of ASL where the coloured die is of
      interest, e.g. for determining the hit location vs. an AFV.

      <p>Now you begin your actions in the Rally Phase. You do this simply by announcing it in the chat window (like you would
      do in a FtF game) and roll the die, e.g. for rally and repair attempts or deployment (by exchanging the counters: delete a
      counter with the context menu and replace it with a new one from of the 467-window). By the way, this is the same method
      how casualties are removed.

      <p>Once your own Rally Phase is finished and it's apparent that the opponent also has to do something in this phase, save
      the log file with "File" - "End Logfile" and send it to your opponent as an email attachment. The opponent saves the log
      file into his game folder, runs his VASL and loads the log file with "File" - "Load Game". Now the board will become
      visible and in the control bar a grey arrow (2nd from left) will become dark. This is the "playback button". With this you
      move step by step through the opponent's log file and watch his actions.

      <p>And now comes the clou: If you hit the "Begin Logfile" button before clicking the "play-back" button, each action done
      afterwards - including the opponent's move play-back, is written into your own log file - this way it is also possible to
      comment the opponent's moves just by writing something in the chat window while playing back his respective action. This
      is especially relevant in the Movement Phase or when firing, for example if your opponent caused your units to undergo a
      morale check. This can be done immediately after his shot by rolling the dice, then you can continue to play-back the
      opponent's move. Usually in the Rally Phase it is not necessary to start a log file before playing back the opponent's log
      file, because there is no interaction between the players and their actions. You can just watch the opponent's Rally Phase
      and then begin your own Rally Phase with the "start Logfile" button. The advantage of not recording the opponent's moves
      again in your own log file is that the opponent is not forced to play-back again his own actions. To re-record every
      movefile is only recommended when you help a beginner by playing an introductory game with him and if you expect him to
      make mistakes - in order to correct his actions immediately or to comment upon the used tactics.

      <p>By the way, it's quite common to announce and do your own following Rally Phase actions at the end of your turn, e.g.
      if you are planning to rally 2 units in the opponent's following Rally Phase and to make a repair attempt in Hex B1. You
      just bring forward this Rally Phase in PbEM after finishing your own CCPh, because this has no effects or impact on the
      opponent's Rally actions. This speeds up game play because the player coming up in the next turn can make his Rally Phase
      and doesn't have to resend the file after this, just to allow you to roll your dice. This way the opponent can begin with
      the Prep Fire Phase immediately after his Rally phase, speeding up the PbEM-play significantly and making it more efficient.

      <p>If both players have ended their Rally Phases, the PFPh of the active player follows. This is recorded, if not yet
      done, by "Begin Logfile". Following this, the phasing player declares his targets and which units fire with how many FP
      factors. Write no novels while doing this; fire declaration is done in a short and pragmatic way.

      <p>Let's assume a 9-2 Leader and a 467-squad with a 2-7 LMG in B13 fire on a 447-squad in B15 (a woods hex). The fire
      declaration would look like this:

      <p>9-2/467/LMG@B13 vs. 447@B15; af:6-1

      <p>Explanation: The Leader (9-2), the squad and the LMG are standing in B13, as shown by use of the abbreviation
      "@"("at"). "af:" specifies the ultimate attack factors, rolled on the IFT or IIFT (all necessary firetables such as IFT,
      IIFT or Ordnance to hit tables are integrated into VASL!). Here the final column used is 6 (for the squad with the LMG on
      the IFT, on the IIFT it would have been 7) and the DRM Modifier is -1 (-2 for the leader, +1 for woods). The DRM is always
      stated as positive or negative number behind the FP-factors (according to the column on which the attack is resolved when
      shooting on the IFT). When playing vs. a beginner, you can declare a more detailed af-resolution, for example "6FP, -2Ld,
      +1woods=-1DRM". Eventually you should internalize the shortcut writing to ensure that you won't become confused when
      playing versus other, more experienced opponents on the VASL-Server or just when watching a game.

      <p>This fire declaration can become quite long - 9-2+467+MMG+447+LMG@B13 PBF vs. 2 &times; 447@B13; af: 30-2. (or, for
      Beginners: 2 &times; 15 for Point Blank Fire, -2 DRM Leader). Accordingly LR means Long Range, if for example a unit is
      firing with half fire power because of longe range fire: 447(LR)@B13&#8230; don't worry, it is not as complicated as it
      looks like and after a short time you will have internalized the system. And of course experienced players may skip such a
      detailed list because for them it's clear what's going on by just following the game. But the more detailed the
      information, the less the confusion and fewer mistakes will happen.

      <p>You carry out one fire attack after the other and you do not send back the file to the opponent after each successful
      attack. If firing on multiple opponents which are not in contact with one another, all these fire attacks are carried out
      in your PFPh, regardless of the attack results. At the end of the PFPh the log file is closed. If nothing happened and all
      attacks have been unsuccessful, there is no need to send the file back and you can continue to the MPh immediately. If the
      result of an attack is a MC or a TC, carry it out for the opponent because it would be nonsense to send him the file back
      just to let him press the dice button.

      <p>If the opponent is in his MPh, he announces the spent MF after each move to a new hex (or location). For example: he
      moves into a forest and afterwards in an open ground hex. So he moves to the forest hex and writes down in the chat
      window: 2. (In games with beginners maybe in addition: 2MF left) . Afterwards he moves to the open ground hex and writes
      down: "1? (1MF left). The opponent can, as in a live game, commit Defensive First Fire at any time he wishes. In order to
      do this, he calls STOP!, if the opponent has moved to a position where his unit can be shot upon and of course he doesn't
      carry on clicking forward in the log file! As soon as the opponent moves further in his log file, the chance for DFF is
      gone like in a FTF game. Because you - as the defender - start the log file at the beginning of the opponent's Movement
      Phase and you don't watch it in advance (Fair play is the highest imperative!), you do not know where the opponent will
      move and so you can conserve the feeling and the suspense of a real FTF-game also in a PbEM-game.

      <p>If you decide to fire on a moving opponent, declare this intention exactly in the moment when the MF were spent. Add
      the attack factors and roll the dice. If the unit fired at is not harmed, go on clicking further in the log file because
      the opponent can move on unhampered. If the enemy suffers a Break or Pin result, you can also go on clicking further in
      the log file but you can ignore what was announced for this unit. Usually you don't send back a move file just because one
      unit was harmed by Defensive Fire. This is a question of experience; if the opponent would run with the next unit into
      Residual FP, you inform your opponent about this in order to allow him to change his mind. If it is apparent that the
      broken unit was of fundamental importance and the opponent's strategy or his further proceeding is overthrown, send the
      file back as a precaution. If in doubt, send it back rather than continue your Defensive First Fire. Otherwise it is
      common to make more DFF against other moving units in this log file, if these attacks do not influence one another.

      <p>When the MPh is done, Defensive Fire Phase commences. If the opponent's Movement file was played-back to the end and
      not sent back (because of several DFF incidents), your DFPh can be written in the same log file as your First Fire. As in
      the Prep Fire Phase, any MC and TC results are rolled by the firing player. At the end of the DFF, the defender closes the
      log file and sends it back to the attacker. The attacker then makes his advancing fire under the same conditions as in
      Prep Fire. Afterwards he routs with his units. If necessary, the opponent gets the file  back to make his own rout
      movements. If it is apparent that the opponent doesn't have to rout, there is no need to send him the file. The active
      player can go on directly to the Advance Phase and the CCPh. Dont' forget to bring forward your own rally phase after
      finishing your turn and then send this file to your opponent. If Close Combat occurs, the attacks are rolled by the
      attacker for both sides.

      <p>&#8230;but you can't do them unnoticed. Each LOS check is logged.

      <p>Now begins the opponent's turn (for example ASL17-AT1a.log) . He begins a new log file without recording the rest of
      the turn from an old file, because usually this is not necessary. This is also a question of experience - to see, when it
      is necessary to record into a log file or when it is sufficient just to watch the opponent's actions. Starting with the
      AFPh or even the Rout Phase, there usually is no need to include these actions into your own log file, except when playing
      with a beginner who probably makes mistakes, for example in routing. The Rally Phase of the previous player was already
      brought forward, so the active player makes his Rally Phase and continues on to the PFPh - of course after announcing
      it&#8230; and the game begins anew.

      <p>Important hint: Please begin a move only with "Begin logfile" - "end logfile" and never mix it up with "Save Game".
      'Save game' only saves the actual picture of the board with the end position of the counters and is used only for setup
      files or in rare cases, when it is not important to record the past actions!

      <h2>4. Online live gaming with VASL</h2>

      <p>Besides the possibility to play PbEM via log files, you can also play VASL with other players online in real time. In
      order to do this, click on the two arrows button (3rd button from the left) to open the server window. Of course you
      should be online at this moment, otherwise nothing will happen&#8230;;)

      <p>The server window opens where you can connect to the VASL server by clicking on another two-arrows-button. You will be
      transported to a kind of lobby in the main chat window, where you can see who is online and which game rooms have been
      opened. You can either stay in the lobby and chat with the people there, or leave a message at the Blackboard if you
      search for an opponent.

      <p>You also have the option to join one of the games in order to watch it as a spectator. But take care of the Netiquette!
      If you join an ongoing game, it is vital to greet the players and ask them if you are allowed to watch their game. Usually
      you may do so. Furthermore, you may never move their counters, although you can see the content of the stacks when you go
      over them with your mouse. Of course you may ask questions in the chat window, for examples if you don't understand a
      certain action - they will answer you. But prattling and talking about other things as well as asking too many questions
      (folks may be playing a ladder game there and are not doing a tutorial, so try not to interrupt them) should be avoided -
      you are only a spectator and should behave like this.

      <p>You can also open a game room on your own and load an existing game or create a new one. Either a stranger joins the
      room or you meet there with a friend (perfect to play with an overseas PbEM friend or to end an idle PbEM game). The rules
      are the same as in an offline game, but it is common to leave the game room while your opponent is doing his setup,
      especially if he uses concealment. You wait in the lobby until he allows you to re-enter your room. Long considering
      during play, hesitating and moving the counters to and fro is to be avoided, because it is impolite and inflates the
      online costs (not everyone is using a flat rate and some are still using dial up connections). A speedy game is desired
      (of course there will be some understanding if you are a beginner and need more time or make mistakes, but clarify this in
      advance!).

      <p>It is recommended to record a live game for your own use with "Begin Logfile" in order to analyze it later, to reflect
      about mistakes or just to send it to a friend. Also you can begin a game online and continue it later PbEM or load a PbEM
      game and finish it online.

      <h2>5. Further Questions?</h2>

      <p>The best way to learn ASL via VASL is by playing with an experienced VASL player. You could log in on the server and
      ask if anybody is interested in playing a small introductory game with a novice. According to experience, the
      ASL-community is extremely helpful and you will find an offer quickly. Your opponent then usually will explain how to
      adjust the preferences and how to declare fire and movement. This is really the fastest and best way to learn VASL.
      Another way is to find a PbEM partner either with the blackboard on the VASL server or on different contact platforms (ASL
      mailing list, the Consimworld ASL folders, or the Opponents Wanted folder of the Gamesquad forum). Of course two novices
      can also try playing together by following the hints given in this tutorial, but the easier way is always with an
      experienced player.

      <p>With VASL the ASL universe opens to each player without a face-to-face gaming partner! We wish you a lot of fun
      and&#8230;roll low!
